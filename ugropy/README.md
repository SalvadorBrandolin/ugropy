## What is this?

This module contains the routines to build the UNIFAC databases. There is no
warranty that all the compounds were correctly parsed in their functional 
groups. It's recommended that the user checks the Chemicals batch used in 
his/her work.

Folders:  
- psrk: functional groups of the Predictive SRK EoS ยน.
- unifac: classic UNIFAC functional groups ยน.
- mod_unifac_do: Modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) ยน.
